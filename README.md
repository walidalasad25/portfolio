# Walid Al Asad — Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains selected engineering and technical projects demonstrating
my approach to problem definition, design, analysis, and execution.

My work focuses on combining mechanical engineering fundamentals with data analysis,
experimentation, and practical software tools to solve real problems.

## Background

I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate student with experience in:
- engineering design and analysis
- experimental research and data-driven optimization
- technical programming and automation

My interests lie at the intersection of advanced manufacturing, mechanical systems,
and computational tools that improve engineering workflows.

## Core Skills

- Mechanical Design & Analysis (SolidWorks, ANSYS)
- Experimental Design & Data Analysis
- Manufacturing & Materials Processing
- Python for engineering workflows and analysis
- Technical documentation and reproducible work

## Projects

### Project 1 — Engineering Project (In Progress)
**Problem:**  
Define and analyze an engineering problem with clear constraints and requirements.

**Approach:**  
- Structured problem definition
- Design and analysis using appropriate engineering tools
- Evaluation of results with clear assumptions

**Tools:**  
SolidWorks, ANSYS, Python

**Outcome:**  
Demonstrated a systematic approach to engineering problem-solving.

### Project 2 — Research / Analysis Project (In Progress)
**Problem:**  
Investigate and analyze a manufacturing or materials-related process.

**Approach:**  
- Experimental or analytical modeling
- Data collection and interpretation
- Iterative refinement of parameters

**Tools:**  
Python, statistical analysis, experimental methods

**Outcome:**  
Clear insights into process behavior and limitations.

## Notes

This portfolio is actively maintained and will expand as projects are completed
and refined. Emphasis is placed on clarity, technical correctness, and evidence-based
results rather than presentation alone.
